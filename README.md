# Toys-Data-Excersice
This project involved using Power BI to load, clean, and analyze data.

After reviewing the dataset for null values and defining key data types, a relational model was created linking the "sales," "products," "store," and "calendar" tables. Calculations such as cost, price, total orders, revenue, and profit were added to the "sales" table. Finally, the data was visualized in an interactive dashboard.
